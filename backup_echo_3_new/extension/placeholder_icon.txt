ICON PLACEHOLDERS

For a complete extension, you'll need to create icon files in the following sizes:
- 16x16 pixels (icon16.png)
- 48x48 pixels (icon48.png)
- 128x128 pixels (icon128.png)

These should be placed in the 'images' directory.

You can create these icons using any image editor. For best results:
1. Use a simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
2. Make sure the icon is clear against both light and dark backgrounds
3. Use the PNG format for transparency support
4. Consider using Google's Material Design guidelines for a cohesive look

Example icon idea for Google Peek:
- A magnifying glass with a small preview/window element
- Blue and white color scheme to match Google's branding
- Simple shapes that are recognizable at small sizes
